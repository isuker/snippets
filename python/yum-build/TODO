1. finish function list_all_packages.
   Goto 'http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/gitweb' webpage to search all pkg name.
   shortage is long time to load that webpage. Is there better way?

2. For those package not found in fedora git, how to handle them?
   Maybe setup a public git/svn repo to save package spec file. 
   We users can upload/modify spec file. A client/server mode are needed??
